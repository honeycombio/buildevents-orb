  start_trace:
    description: |
      start_trace should be run in a job all on its own at the very beginning of
      a build. This job initializes the buildevents config, downloads the
      buildevents binary, and otherwise gets the build environment ready for the
      rest of the jobs.
    steps:
      ### set up buildevents
      - run:
          name: setup honeycomb buildevents and start trace
          command: |
            # set up our working environment and timestamp the trace
            mkdir -p ~/project/bin/be-linux-x86_64 ~/project/bin/be-linux-aarch64 ~/project/bin/be-darwin-arm64/ /tmp/buildevents/
            date +%s > /tmp/buildevents/build_start
      - download_be_executables
      - run:
          name: make them executable
          command: chmod 755 ~/project/bin/be*/buildevents
      - save_be_cache
      - run:
          name: report_step
          command: ~/project/bin/be-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m)/buildevents step $CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID setup $(cat /tmp/buildevents/build_start) start_trace

  watch_build_and_finish:
    description: |
      watch_build_and_finish will poll the CircleCI API to determine when the
      build is done. It should be its own job dependent on the job that runs
      start_trace, and no job should depend on it finishing.
    parameters:
      timeout:
        description: Timeout after which we consider the build failed, in minutes. Should be at least double your longest expected build.
        type: integer
        default: 20
    steps:
      - restore_be_cache
      - run:
          name: watch then finish build trace
          command: |
            # set the timeout
            export BUILDEVENT_TIMEOUT=<< parameters.timeout >>
            ~/project/bin/be-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m)/buildevents watch $CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID

  finish:
    description: |
      finish is an alternative to watch_build_and_finish. If you can't create a
      CircleCI API token or want to manually finish the trace, you can use this
      command to do so. If you can, it's recommended that you use
      watch_build_and_finish instead of this command.
    parameters:
      result:
        description: The final status of the build. Should be either "success" or "failure".

  add_context:
    description: |
      add_context is a function to add additional fields to the span
      representing this job. It can be called multiple times, each with one
      value. It is useful for adding things like artifact sizes, parameters to
      the job, and so on. Call this with two arguments - the field name and the
      field value. Both name and value must be strings, but numbers will be
      coerced before getting sent to Honeycomb. Names must be single words;
      values can be longer strings. This must be used within the context of
      `with_job_span`
    parameters:
      field_name:
        description: the name of the field to add to the surrounding step
        type: string
      field_value:
        description: the value of the field to add to the surrounding step
        type: string
      verbose:
        description: |
          if set to `true`, the extra context field name and content will be
          evaluated and echoed to your build log in addition to being sent to
          Hoenycomb
        type: boolean
        default: false
    steps:
      - run:
          name: adding extra field - << parameters.field_name >>
          command: |
            if [ "<< parameters.verbose >>" == "true" ] ; then
              echo "adding the following context to the trace:"

  berun:
    description: |
      berun executes a command and creates a span representing that command. The
      bename parameter will be the name of the span. berun must be used within a
      step decorated by with_job_span.
    parameters:
      bename:
        type: string
      becommand:
        type: string
    steps:

  create_marker:
    description: |
      create_marker can run independently without any other buildevent orb commands
      or setup running beforehand, it only requires curl and jq to be present
    parameters:

        description: |
          the API key used to create the marker; defaults to `BUILDEVENT_APIKEY`

      dataset:
        description: |
          the dataset within which to create the marker; if not explicitly set,
          will use the environment variable `BUILDEVENT_DATASET`, and if that is
          not set, will fallback to the literal value "buildevents"

        default: "${BUILDEVENT_DATASET:-buildevents}"
      message:
        description: |

          if a URL is specified along with a message, the message will be shown as
          a link in the UI, and clicking it will take you to the URL; defaults to
          the value of `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL`
