  add_context is a function to add additional fields to the span
  representing this job. It can be called multiple times, each with one
  value. It is useful for adding things like artifact sizes, parameters to
  the job, and so on. Call this with two arguments - the field name and the
  field value. Both name and value must be strings, but numbers will be
  coerced before getting sent to Honeycomb. Names must be single words;
  values can be longer strings. This must be used within the context of
  `with_job_span`
parameters:
  field_name:
    description: the name of the field to add to the surrounding step
    type: string
  field_value:
    description: the value of the field to add to the surrounding step
    type: string
  verbose:
    description: |
      if set to `true`, the extra context field name and content will be
      evaluated and echoed to your build log in addition to being sent to
      Honeycomb
    type: boolean
    default: false
steps:
  - run:
      name: adding extra field - << parameters.field_name >>
      command: |
        if [ "<< parameters.verbose >>" == "true" ] ; then
          echo "adding the following context to the trace:"
          echo field: << parameters.field_name >>
          echo value: << parameters.field_value >>
        fi
        echo << parameters.field_name >>=\"<< parameters.field_value >>\" >> /tmp/buildevents/extra_fields.lgfmt
